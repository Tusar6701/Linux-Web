# Linux-Web

## Webpage to run Linux commands on the web-browser
 
 Download the project files in their respective folders as they appear in the repository to use it. 
 The driver page is `homepage.html` under the folder named `completed`.
 
 ### How it works?
 1. Homepage calls for `login` or `sign-up` depending upon what the user wants
 2. Upon logging in, the Username and Password are verified by `login.js` under the folder named `js` 
      a. If they are invalid, three attempts are given to rectify the mistake after which the fields are locked
      b. If the credentials are valid, the user is redirected to `GotoTerminal.html` under the folder `completed` which displays a message of successful login
 3. Upon hitting the Go to Terminal button within `GotoTerminal.html`, the user is redirected to `online.html` under the folder 'mainpage' 
 4. This page does the entire work of taking the input commands from the user and printing the output in the adjacent `frame` section.
 
 *The text field can take both linux commands as well as 'Docker' commands as input*
